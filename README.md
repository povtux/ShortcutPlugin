# ShortcutPlugin

plugin for QuickLauncher (https://github.com/povtux/QuickLauncher) that displays a shortcut list based on an XML file distributed by a webserver.

each entry can be either an URL or a program to run. On each entry, you can specify if a VPN is needed for it to work (displays an icon in front of the link to inform the user). On URL, you can also choose to let it open with the default web browser of the user or for the openning with a MS browser (Edge for Win10, else IE). This can be usefull if many users chooses FireFox or Chrome and some of your tools must run on IE or Edge.
